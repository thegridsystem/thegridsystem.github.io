As part of our Shell Energy Challenge project, we have built a fully functioning online web system wherby users can monitor energy statistics from all over the city.

## Firebase Backend

We're using the Google Firebase Cloud platform to provide easy to use authentication among many providers and to be able to store user's data in an organisaed and dynamic database.

## Installation

Clone the project with git clone and serve with a local server program such as Apache or Express. Be sure to change any linkbacks to our original demo page with your own pages.

## API Reference
